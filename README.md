# Python_AIRS_Tool
A python app that runs in the background to detect security threats like DOS, Brute Force, etc, File Upload Vulnerabilty and SQL injection attack.
This is an interactive tool, that is different from the other AIRS tools currently available that require a complex setup.
It can be downloaded and installed to run in the background, and the app starts it's works.
The tKinter GUI is interactive and provides toggle switches for the 4 attacks, for the users to chose for which attacks they want to run the app.
Not only does it detect the attack but also responds to it appropriately, such as blocking that ip address etc.,
Users can use this to protect their websites from malicious actors as a defensive security measure.
